As of November 28, 2007, the rumored new Warren Ellis community makes its debut at www.freakangels.com/whitechapel. Initially conceived as a place to discuss the upcoming webcomic FreakAngels by Ellis and artist Paul Duffield, WHITECHAPEL has since grown into Ellis' new home on the net. Conceptualized by Ellis, Whitechapel is funded and hosted by Avatar Press, and its construction and continued maintenance are the workings of Ariana Osborne, with assistance from Avatar Creative Director Mark Seifert.

"My website, warrenellis.com, is where I work and speak," says Ellis. "But Whitechapel is now where I live. If the place looks a bit weird, especially in comparison to my previous online communities, it's because I wanted this one to reflect my interests, rather than just force you to buy stuff or attempt to take over your mind. Frankly, mind control is easy. It's having to look at all that weird crap in your head that's hard."

Whitechapel is a precursor to the much-anticipated FreakAngels webcomic by Ellis and Duffield, coming to FreakAngels.com beginning in February, 2008. It is also the newest community Ellis has developed, following such boards as the immensely popular site The Engine which closed its doors early this year. Speaking about Whitechapel's branching functionality Ellis says, "I'm not especially interested in a comics-centric board like the Engine. Which tends to beg the question of what a message board/online community should do. The Engine was originally raised for serious purpose. The new place, not so much. For me, it's more of an overlook: a place to live and watch the world go by."

WHITECHAPEL is now open for viewing and registration at www.freakangels.com/whitechapel. It uses a new system (Vanilla) that supports such options as a Member Map and linking Flickr photo feeds to profiles. Open to people of all interests, the message board will also work in part as a 10 week lead into the launch of the long form webcomic FreakAngels by Ellis and Duffield, which debuts in February, 2008.

Avatar Press is a comic book publisher that continues to push the boundaries between mainstream and independent with current and upcoming work from creators such as Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Warren Ellis, Garth Ennis, Brian Pulido, George A. Romero, George R.R. Martin, Joe R. Lansdale, John Russo, Mike Wolfer, Juan Jose Ryp, Jacen Burrows, and numerous others. The company has published a wide range of comic books including creator-owned titles like Garth Ennis' 303 and Brian Pulido's Lady Death, company-owned comics such as Pandora and The Ravening, licensed hits like Frank Miller's Robocop and George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, and numerous other titles. A publisher that has established itself as one of the cornerstones of the American indy comic book scene over the past decade, Avatar has published some 500 comic books since 1997.

None";s:4:"link";s:75:"http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/oddball/index.cgi?date=2006-03-24";s:11:"description";s:7474:"This week's selection is the shocking giveaway comic ELECTRIC SAFETY FROM A TO ZAP!, -- featuring the most complex cat-and-mouse relationship since Krazy Kat and Ignatz! Are its stars friendly enemies or suicide-prone co-dependents? You decide! 
This 16-page giveaway comic features only two characters, an unnamed orange cat and an unnamed grey mouse. In the cat-vs-mouse cartoon tradition of TOM AND JERRY, HERMAN AND KATNIP, PIXIE AND DIXIE AND MR. JINKS and ITCHY AND SCRATCHY, this uncredited comic begins with a series of try/fail gags with the cat attempting to catch the mouse. First, the cat climbs a tree and tries to grab the mouse, who's hanging from a power line. When the cat touches the wire, he gets shocked with a big "ZAP" sound effect. Next, the cat chases the mouse past an extension cord, one that's missing part of its insulation. When the cat comes in contact with it, he gets fried with another "ZAP" sound effect. Then the cat leans around a corner, intent on pouncing on the mouse. But when his tail accidentally pokes inside an electrical wall outlet - you guessed it - he gets nothing but another fur-singeing "ZAP" for his efforts. Taking advantage of their time out, the mouse gives an impromptu lecture to his feline antagonist:

MOUSE:
If you go on like this, nine lives will hardly be enough!

CAT:
Yes, it's awful! They seem to hit me when I least expect it!

MOUSE:
Those zaps are going to get you if you don't watch out!

CAT:
Oh, I know! It's making me quite nervous!

MOUSE:
They wouldn't if you knew what to look for!

The mouse goes on to explain and demonstrate the concept of energy, first using a teeter-totter, then using a variety of devices and appliances found around the house. Puzzled, the cat points to an electrical wall outlet:

CAT:
Amazing! How can all that energy hide in such tiny little holes?

MOUSE:
It doesn't! It comes from a power plant through wires in the wall! When you plug in something, the energy flows through the wires to the fan motorfeeding it the strength to turn the fan around!

CAT:
Why doesn't the energy come out of these other holes?

MOUSE:
It's there, but it doesn't do anything until there is someplace for it to go, likeDON'T GET TOO CLOSE!

Once again, the cat gets shocked when he pokes his paw into the outlet. As the cat recovers, the mouse explains further about how electricity is "a good traveler":

MOUSE:
That's why it's such a useful and unusual form of energy! It travels easily through metal! That's why wire are made of metal. And it travels easily through the ground, or through things that are wet, or anything with a lot of water in it!

CAT:
You mean like trees and growing thingsor peopleor animals?

MOUSE:
Yes, like you! And like a good traveler, it takes short cuts - follows an easier path whenever it has a chance!

When the cat asks how electricity is kept "in" the wire, the mouse continues his lecture:

MOUSE:
It's only possible because electric energy can't travel through some materials, like glass, or rubber, or plastic 
CAT:
So it can't take a short cut through the ground or something wet?

MOUSE:
Right! And that's important. Most of the wires in our house are actually two or more wires, each protected with a rubber or plastic covering to keep the energy flowing through the separate wires! If this covering is broken or wears off, you can get a zap! If a wire is broken and the two open ends are close together, the electric energy may be strong enough to jump the space. Then some of the energy will make heat that can start a fire!

CAT:
I'll throw water on it and put it out!

MOUSE:
NO! NO! First, make sure there is no electric energy flowing near the fire! Then put it out!

Then the mouse tries to explain the concepts of power plants and the substations that distribute the electrical energy they provide:

CAT:
Those are the place that have signs saying "Danger, High Voltage". What does that mean?

MOUSE:
It means STAY AWAY, or you might get zapped! All the wires and things around substations can be very dangerous!

Next, the cat learns about electrical switches in the home and how they work, flipping the lights on and off. Moving outside, the mouse attempts to teach the cat about power lines:

MOUSE:
The wires in our houses are not as big or as powerful a the branch lines outside. And the largest wires, the trunk lines that carry the energy from the power plant to the substations are so powerfulthat the wires have to be far apart and kept far enough from the pole with insulators to that the energy just can't find a path to the pole!

CAT:
What was that?

MOUSE:
Some careless or selfish person shot at the insulator with a gun! Now there's the danger that the energy can jump to the pole and find a path to the groundand zap somebody!

Next, the foolish cat climbs a tree to retrieve a kite caught on a power line. When the mouse warns him about the danger, the cat points to a bird sitting on the power line:

CAT: How about that bird? Why doesn't he get zapped?

MOUSE:
Because electric energy follows the easiest path. Going through the bird is a "detour" that doesn't go to the ground or anything that attracts energy, but if you're in a tree and get too near the wire...you're offering an easy path to the ground!

CAT: Maybe I was just born unlucky!

MOUSE:
It would have been worse if you had been any closer to that wire!

CAT:
I know! I know! I wish I could just forget about zaps - pretend they don't exist!

But the mouse refuses to let the cat give up. He tells his friendly enemy to think "zap" every time he starts to climb near power lines, when he's near a substation or a sign reading "Danger, High Voltage", when he's in the bathtub or standing on a wet floor and using an electrical appliance, when there's a thunderstorm before going into the water or under a tree and when he's around any electrical device that looks damaged.

CAT:
Oh, I will! I will!

MOUSE: But the main thing isbe alertbe careful! Don't let curiosity "zap" the cat! And remember, electrical energy is always looking for a shorter path Be sure you don't become the path! After allWHO WANTS TO BE A ZAP?

(So what the heck's been going on here? The cat wants to catch the mouse --but the mouse wants to save the cat's nine lives from getting snuffed out by repeated run-ins with electricity? If there was a second issue of this comic, would it show the cat counseling the mouse about the fatal dangers of hanging around hungry felines? Is ELECTRIC SAFETY FROM A TO ZAP! an educational comic about electrical safety, or this actually a comic book about suicide prevention? Oddball minds need to know!)

ODDBALL Factoid - MAD creator Harvey Kurtzman wrote his own history of the American comic book titled FROM ARGH! TO ZAP! HARVEY KURTZMAN'S VISUAL HISTORY OF THE COMICS! (written with Michael Barrier and published in 1991.) Hmmm, sound familiar?

Bonus ODDBALL Factoid - Although completely unrelated to ELECTRIC SAFETY FROM A TO ZAP!, sixteen issues (including a No. 0 and No. 7, a mini-comic) of the similarly-titled ZAP COMIX, an underground comic book, were published between 1968 and 2005!

A Famous Studios theatrical cartoon short released by Paramount in 1945, it was based upon an unpublished children's book written by Seymour Reit and illustrated by Joe Oriolo. The second cartoon to star Casper (whose actual name wasn't established until he starred in h is own comic book) wasn't released until 1948, but soon, an entire series of Casper cartoons were produced, making the leap from theaters (the last theatrical short was released in 1959) to television (the first made-for-television CASPER cartoon was made in 1963). St. John published the first CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST comic book in September, 1949; in 1952, Harvey Comics took over the publication of the series, and in 1959, bought the rights to the character. Soon, Harvey expanded Casper's world, with new stories featuring the Ghostly Trio, Wendy The Good Little Witch, Spooky The Tuff Little Ghost and his long-suffering girlfriend Pearl, Hot Stuff The Devil Kid, Nightmare the ghost-horse and many others. In fact, Casper was so successful for Harvey that it wasn't long before other publishers came up with their own "friendly ghosts", including SUPER SPOOK, SPENCER SPOOK, TIMMY THE TIMID GHOST, HOMER THE HAPPY GHOST, SPUNKY THE SMILING SPOOK, LI'L GHOST and many others.

In 1941, three brothers - Leon, Robert and Alfred Harvey - co-founded Harvey Comics. Originally publishing a line of unremarkable anthology titles, their first big hit was THE BLACK CAT, a strip set in Hollywood starring a sexy costumed heroine. Harvey also achieved a degree of success when they took over publication of THE GREEN HORNET. But what put them on the funnybook map was their licensing of various comic strip characters, including JOE PALOOKA, BLONDIE, DICK TRACY, MUTT AND JEFF and SAD SACK, among others. By this time, Harvey had also been publishing horror, war and romance comics, but when they acquired the rights to print CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST, the company's focus began to change, and by 1957, when Harvey bought the rights to Paramount's stable of cartoon characters, their output shifted to mostly so-called "kiddie comics", with the exception of Joe Simon's outlandish line of "Harvey Thrillers" during the superhero boom of the mid-1960s and BUNNY, "Queen Of The In-Crowd", an attempt to carve off some of the teen marked dominated by Archie Comics.

All comic book muck-monsters are in one way or another derived from the title-character of Theodore Sturgeon's 1940 short story, "It!" These include Hillman's "The Heap" (created by Harry Stein and Mort Leav in the pages of AIR FIGHTERS COMICS No. 3, December, 1942), DC's "Solomon Grundy" (created by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman in ALL-AMERICAN COMICS No. 61, cover-dated October, 1944), Marvel's "pre-hero" monsters (including "The Glob" from JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY, "Taboo! The Thing From Murky Swamp!" and "The Thing CalledIt!" from STRANGE TALES and "The Creature From The Black Bog!" from TALES OF SUSPENSE) by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, DC's "Swamp Thing" (created by Len Wein and Berni Wrightson in HOUSE OF SECRETS No. 92, cover-dated June-July, 1971), Marvel's "Man-Thing" (created by Roy Thomas, Gerry Conway and Gray Morrow in SAVAGE TALES No. 1, May, 1971) and even the underground comix characters "the Turd" (created by Scott Shaw! in Ken Krueger's GORY STORIES QUARTERLY No. 2 1/2 and "Dorrgsheett" (from Dave Gibson's all-star DORGSHEETT DIGEST, which was entirely devoted to disgustingly gooey poo-creatures!) Just as DC Comics seemed to have an infatuation with gorillas and dinosaurs, Marvel displayed a similar attraction to muck-monsters, apparently to exploit mankind's fear of its own fecal waste-matter. But who ever expected to find Harvey Comics - purveyors of otherwise squeaky-clean kiddie comics - to contribute to this somewhat nauseating tradition?

Harvey Comics' "Voo Doo Doo" was designed and drawn by cartoonist Warren Kremer (6/26/1921 - 7/24/2003), whose distinctive drawing and storytelling has come to represent the house-style of Harvey Comics. The Bronx-born cartoonist was the son of a commercial sign painter, and graduated from New York's High School Of Music and Art and the School Of Industrial Arts. Influenced by Alex (FLASH GORDON) Raymond and Hal (PRINCE VALIANT) Foster, Warren's early work included illustrations for pulp magazines, particularly those with a theme of aviation. His first comic book gig was HAP HAZARD for Ace Comics; Warren also married the feature's letterer, Grace. In 1948, he began a 35-year-long relationship with Harvey Comics, first illustrating horror comics, but eventually specializing in appealing "kiddie" comics such as CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST, HOT STUFF THE DEVIL KID, PLAYFUL LITTLE AUDREY, RICHIE RICH THE POOR LITTLE RICH KID and STUMBO THE GIANT, among others, as well as serving as the publisher's Art Editor. When Harvey Comics stopped producing original material in 1983, Kremer followed editor Sid Jacobson over to Marvel, where he worked on TOP DOG, PLANET TERRY, ROYAL ROY, EWOKS, FLINTSTONE KIDS and COUNT DUCKULA, among others. One day, when Warren dropped off some artwork at Marvel, staffer (and extraordinary cartoonist) Marie Severin was heard to remark, "They don't know it, but this is the best artist who ever walked through these doors."

There's really only one actual Oddball aspect of this issue of CASPER'S GHOSTLAND - part of Harvey Comics' line of 64-page "Giant Size" funnybooks -- but it's an absolute doozy! I'm referring to the three-part, 15-page "Casper The Friendly Ghost" story penciled by Warren Kremer, the first chapter of which is titled "Powfinger". It begins as the Casper scolds the Ghostly Trio - Fatso, Fusso and Lazo*) - about making their bed. Fed up with him, the trio take a big breath and blow their immaterial housemate right through the wall! Flung outside, the friendly ghost shows a rarely-seen side of his personality, until he's interrupted by a fancily-dressed stranger wearing a top hat:

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
TrioSometimes I wish I were BIG enough to 
STRANGER:
SIGN RIGHT HERE! 
CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
HUH?

STRANGER:
Sign right here and your WISHES will come TRUE

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
But I really DIDN'T wish 
STRANGER:
Of COURSE you did! EVERYBODY wants something. Sign this simple contract and HAPPINESS is yours

But when Casper reads down to some indecipherable fine print, he hands the "standard wish application" back to the devilish stranger. Suddenly, the stranger's demeanor becomes instantly irritated, annoyed that Casper's wasting his time, as he strides off into the Enchanted Forest. Casper's attention is drawn elsewhere, when he hears poor Gnomey the gnome yelling at a huge, hairy troll who's sitting on top of his toadstool home. The big bully taunts Gnomey:

TROLL:
I've got more strength in my LITTLE FINGER than you have in your WHOLE BODY!

Fortunately for Gnomey, when Casper shows up on the scene, the frightened troll takes off, insisting that he's not scared of ghosts. But Gnomey remains angry and frustrated, so much so that when the well-dressed stranger appears, he anxiously signs his mysterious contract. The stranger presents him with a special ring - and name:

STRANGER:
Hold out your little finger! You are now "POWFINGER"! Have fun!

Wondering what his new moniker signifies, Gnomey soon finds out, when he topples a mighty oak with one touch of his little finger! And when Casper refers to him as "Gnomey", the little gnome uses his pinkie to "pow" the friendly ghost off of his feet, too! Now more of a bully than the troll ever was, "Powfinger" stalks away, leaving Casper to worry about the fine print in his "standard wish application". This story's second chapter, "Today The Swamp", continues as Casper catches up to "Powfinger" in a particularly creepy area of the Enchanted Forest - the Scary Swamp! While "Powfinger" belligerently calls out a challenge for his troll tormentor, Casper makes nice with a .local crocodile:

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
I'm Casper the friendly ghostand 
CROCODILE:
GHOST! Hey, WAIT A MINUTE! Who's AFRAID of ghosts?

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
You're NOT? I'm so GLAD!

CROCODILE:
In this swamp here are things so SCARY, ghosts look like FRIENDS!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
I AM a friend!

CROCODILE:
Don't CONFUSE me! There are WEEJUMS and WOOJUMS and the DREADED VOO DOO DOO!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
BRRR! The NAMES give me the chills!

Casper asks his new friend to help him read the fine print on "Powfinger's" contract, but even with excellent eyesight, the crocodile has the same difficulty that Casper has every time he tries to read it:

CROCODILE:
HmmmThat's FUNNY! The HARDER you look, the SMALLER it gets!

Then a passing vulture drops in and volunteers to give it a try, claiming that vultures have the best eyesight in the world - but he's equally frustrated by the "standard wish agreement" contract that Casper shows him:

VULTURE:
The print keeps getting SMALLER and SMALLER! What are you, some kind of a MAGICIAN?

Suddenly, Casper hears a call for help - it's Gnomey, er, "Powfinger", sinking in a pit of quicksand! Casper flies to his rescue, but once he's pulled the little gnome out of the goo, he's attacked by a gnome-hungry Weejum! But without raising a sweat, "Powfinger" knocks out the attacking Weejum with one touch of his little finger. Casper tries to get him to read the fine print on his contract, but power-hungry "Powfinger" doesn't express the slightest interest. All he cares about is facing down the troll who bullied him earlier:

GNOMEY/"POWFINGER":
Now, listen, Casper, and listen GOODALL MY LIFE I've been LITTLE and AFRAID of everybody! Now everybody's going to be afraid of ME, POWFINGER! And I don't CARE what the fine print saysOR YOU EITHER! TROLL!

In response to "Powfinger's" call, the monstrous troll shows upand once again, he uses his pinkie to spectacular effect:

GNOMEY/"POWFINGER":
TODAY the SWAMPTOMORROW the WORLD!

"Powfinger" even gets so carried away that he accidentally "pows" himself in the head! But this gaffe doesn't seem to reduce his newly-inflated ego one bit:

GNOMEY/"POWFINGER":
WATCH yourself, Casper! I've been nice to you so far because we USED to be FRIENDS! NOW HEAR THIS, SWAMP CREATURES! POWFINGER IS TAKING OVER! Any OBJECTIONS, dreaded (HA HA) Woojum?

But apparently, one of the denizens of the Scary Swamp does have an objection:

WOOJUM:
It's the SUPERDREADED VOO DOO DOO!

The third chapter, "The Fine Print", concludes as the other creatures of the swamp run for their lives from the dreaded Voo Doo Doo, who emerges from the murky waters. "Powfinger", however, remains unimpressed:

GNOMEY/"POWFINGER":
JUST A MINUTE, THERE! What's so great about HIM?

VULTURE:
You don't KNOW about the Voo Doo Doo? He's the great MUD CREATURE from the BOTTOM of the SWMP! If he SEIZES you in his great mud arms he'll take you to the BOTTOM of the SWAMP and you'll NEVER be HEARD FROM again!

With that, Voo Doo Doo attacks "Powfinger", who's pinkie is surprisingly ineffective against the swamp monster:

CROW:
HA HA HA, bigshot! Mud will ABSORB any impact!

But before any real damage can occur, Casper intercedes, trying to smooth things over, while unintentionally (?) luring Voo Doo Doo away from the moisture-providing swamp as it tries to grab the little ghost in its gooey arms:

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
UhWait, Mr. Voo Doo Doo! Little Gnomey here didn't MEAN any HARM!

VOO DOO DOO:
ARGH!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
You see, he has this NEW POWERand I'm afraid it's GONE to his HEAD!

WOOJUM:
LOOK! The LITTLE GHOST is luring Voo Doo Doo AWAY from the POOL!

WEEJUM:
He's DRYING OUT!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
PLEASE, Mr. Voo Doo Doo! Is it GOOD for you to be so dry?

VOO DOO DOO:
ARGH!

Suddenly, Voo Doo Doo accidentally trips on an exposed root and falls right on top of "Powfinger", who shields himself with his hand. The instant that his pinkie finger comes into contact with Voo Doo Doo, it blasts the muck-monster into muddy molecules:

SFX:
POW

WEEJUM:
WOW! Powfinger DESTROYED VOO DOO DOO!

WOOJUM:
He is INDEED RULER of the SWAMP!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
GOLLY! Voo Doo Doo is just a MOUND of EARTH!

SUNFLOWER CREATURE:
Not JUST earththat's BEAUTIFUL TOPSOIL!

(If anyone remains unconvinced as to the fecal nature of funnybook muck-monsterswell, there's your proof!) Suddenly, the mysterious stranger in the top hat reappears, to finally reveal the fine print of "Powfinger's" contract -- "YOU ARE MY SLAVE"! With some sort of "evil current" emanating from the tip of his cane, the mysterious stranger - no longer nearly so charming - drags away poor "Powfinger", whose pow-ers are ineffective against his new master. Casper bravely tries to intercede on his friend's behalf, but he's blasted - and apparently destroyed (how do you kill a ghost?) - by the stranger's current. "Powfinger" reacts to Casper's death is a manner that's probably as melodramatic as a Harvey Comic can possibly get:

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
I'll save you, GnomeyOH!

GNOMEY/"POWFINGER":
OH, CASPER! WAIT, MASTER! IT'S CASPER! MY FRIEND! SNIFF! OH, CASPER! I'M SO SORRY! SOB!

Driven by grief, "Powfinger" suddenly manages to generate one final "pow", knocking his master off of his feet! As Casper slowly revives (See? You can't kill a ghost!), the stranger demands to take back his contract:

GNOMEY:
What HAPPENED?

STRANGER:
That DRATTED GHOST made you THINK of SOMEONE BESIDE YOURSELF! My magic's no good against THAT!

Gnomey assists the still-dazed Casper to get back onto his feet:

GNOMEY:
Geeit's nice to be able to TOUCH someone without KNOCKING him DOWN! And you know what, Casper! I don't FEEL SMALL anymore!

CASPER THE FRIENDLY GHOST:
Why SHOULD you?

An untitled, one-page "Wendy" gag-strip. When Wendy has to transport a ton of goodies to the "ghost kiddie party", she borrows Pearl's bow ribbon to strap herself to her flying broom.

"Wendy, The Good Little Witch" in "Secret Agent Witch", drawn by Marty Taras. - Wendy is so impressed with the gadgets of her favorite TV hero "Secret Agent 1478325 1/2" that she seeks out Casper the friendly ghost to share a game of "secret agent" with her. She tells her ghostly friend to pretend that he's a bad guy and to take her wand away from her. But before he can comply, a nasty ogre interrupts them and grabs Wendy's wand. Fortunately for them, Wendy had previously put a spell on a prickly cactus to make it appear to be her wand! When the mean ogre recovers from his wounds, he grabs Wendy and shakes her upside-down to dislodge her wand. But again, Wendy has a trick in store for him; the wand multiplies itself into a huge stack of exact duplicates, with Wendy hanging onto the original. When the ogre chases and corners them, Wendy transforms herself and Casper into a pair of ferocious wild bobcats, who scratch and tear at the ogre until he runs away. (In a confusing leap of logic, Wendy and Casper then thank the two bobcats for their help!) Finally, Wendy gives one of her spare wands to Casper. When it turns into a banana, Casper peels it and tosses away the peel, claiming "Well, at least this weapon won't hurt anyone!" But when a passing pink bunny rabbit slips on the peel, he pointedly challenges Casper's assertion.

"Spooky The Tuff Little Ghost" in "Basic Training", drawn by Warren Kremer. - Spooky's startled awake when a huge boot falls on his bed, nearly crushing him. He wonders if a passing giant has somehow lost his shoe, but he soon discovers that it's just the misguided handiwork of Ginger, a young witch whose witchy aunt is attempting to train her in the black arts. When the little witch nearly destroys the roof of Spooky's house while practicing broom-flying, he vows to get even - but the old witch sends his own "boo" back against him! Determined, Spooky "fights fire with fire" by recruiting his own young student, a little ghost named Fireball, to learn "how to be a ghost". When the little ghost slaps Ginger in the face, she retaliates by casting a spell to give him gigantic ears. Instead, the neophyte mini-witch's magic adds giant ears to Spooky's house. Then, when she tries to transform the kid ghost's head into a chimney, all she accomplishes is to add two extra chimneys onto the roof of Spooky's cabin. When the old witch interrupts Ginger and Fireball competitive game of magical hide-and-seek, the little witch hurls a spell at Spooky's ghostly student - which promptly turns him into a blue witch! This - and the fact that his house is now nearly unrecognizable (somewhere along the way it acquired a pair of giant bat-wings!) -- disgusts Spooky to the point that he gives up on his original plan and opts, instead, to "raise the roof" - literally! He belts out such a resounding "Boo!" that it hurls his cabin high into the air, and upon landing, it completely re-builds itself in its original form. Spooky's boo-blast also has the desirable effect of chasing away Ginger and her witchy auntie, but he still has to contend with Fireball, who's still a witch. But when his young student insists on more lessons in how to be a ghost, Spooky is only too glad to cooperate. The final panel of this story shows Spooky chasing Fireball, driving his young charge ahead of him with one big "boo" after another. 
An untitled, one-page "Spooky" gag-strip, penciled by Howard Post. Crossing a desert, Spooky takes refuge from the sun inside a giant's shoe; when its owner returns, Spooky gets rid of him with a really big "Shoo!" (This is a reference to TV variety host Ed Sullivan.)

An untitled, one-page "Casper" gag-strip, penciled by Warren Kremer. Poor Mr. Bear is suffering from insomnia, but when he realizes that Casper is a ghost, he faints -- and finally gets a good night's sleep in the process.

"Flash Farrell Gets The Picture At Goodyear Aerospace", a strip-ad -- drawn by Neal Adams -- for Goodyear bicycle tires.

"Casper The Friendly Ghost" in "The Mysterious Statue", penciled by Warren Kremer. - This is the first of a three-part storyline; it begins when Casper drops by the Ghostly Trio's house, only to find them practicing for a "scare raid". Unwilling to participate in this - or their game of "peek-a-BOO" - Casper heads over to see his friend, Wendy the good little witch. On the way, he bumps into Something, a mischievous little ghost he knows. Together, they pay a visit to Wendy, who's been whipping up a batch of "yummy"-smelling witches' brew. Something watches her uses her magic want to conjure up a jar of spices to mix into some cake batter. Then he grabs her wand and gestures with it, hoping to conjure up some goodies, but instead, he accidentally uses the magic wand to turn its master into a stone statue! And making matters even worse, Something accidentally drops Wendy's magic wand into Wendy's blazing fireplace, burning it to a cinder. If they can't replace the wand, it looks like Wendy is doomed to being a statue for all time! Fortunately, Casper has an idea. Through a series of flashbacks (a potentially-confusing-to-young-readers storytelling device that Harvey Comics usually avoided), we're shown how Wendy was given the wand after saving old Greta The Sorceress in gratitude for saving her from a mean bear up on Magic Mountain. Determined to change their friend back into flesh and blood, Casper and Something set out across the Burning Desert toward Magic Mountain. (To be continued.)

An untitled, two-page "Ghostly Trio" gag-strip, penciled by Warren Kremer. The trouble-making Ghostly Trio invades a costume party, but the guests are scared a bit - they think the ghosts are merely in disguise. But when the Trio gives up and start to fade out, they accidentally scare everyone, to their great mutual delight.

"Casper The Friendly Ghost" in "Magic Mountain", penciled by Warren Kremer. - Continuing the storyline from "The Mysterious Statue", Casper and Something the ghost manage to cross The Burning Desert and ascend to the top of Magic Mountain, where they discover a huge medieval castle that's protected by a thick, invisible barrier. Unable to enter it, they take an alternate route, but run afoul of a huge and overaggressive crow. But when Something's frightening-sounding crying triggers an avalanche, the crow decides to take off. Casper and Something cleverly take shelter from the rockslide by hiding within the boulder. The next impediment to their progress is a field full of hungry giant man-eating flowers, but Casper and Something easily avoid it by flying above the famished flora. As they approach the castle's front gate, they find it guarded by a "great big pussy cat" -- a grumpy lion. After the mischievous little ghost yanks its tail, the lion chases Something back into the field of carnivorous flowers. When Something is swallowed by a particularly aggressive breed of the perilous posies, he uses his ghostly powers to become immaterial and escape. But when the lion gets gobbled up as well, sympathetic Casper uses a sprig of goldenrod to make his flowery captor to sneeze, setting free the grateful feline -- who now volunteers to take them to Greta The Sorceress. (To be continued.)

"Casper The Friendly Ghost" in "Greta The Sorceress", penciled by Warren Kremer. - Continuing the story from "Magic Mountain", this final chapter begins as Casper introduces himself and Something to Greta The Sorceress. She mistakes them for evil spirits, and when Casper tells he that Wendy needs a replacement for the destroyed wand that Greta once gave her, the sorceress thinks they're trying to trick her. Distracted while she looks through a book of spells to banish the "evil" ghosts, Greta doesn't notice when Casper and Something turn themselves invisible. But when Something tries to hide inside an old vase ("to be doubly safe"), he knocks it over and reveals their presence to Greta. The green-skinned sorceress goes to her magic mirror to help locate her uninvited guests, but when Casper whispers a suggestion in her ear - one that Greta assumes is a "brainstorm" - she asks to see Wendy. Seeing that Casper was telling the truth all along, Greta takes him and Something upstairs, where she shows them an entire trunk of wands! Something eagerly grabs one of them and tries to concoct some magic, but without success. Greta explains that she hasn't yet put the magic into the wand yet. After blasting it with her powers of sorcery, Greta uses it to materialize an elephant, then turn it into a tiny mouse, then transform Something into an elongated giant! Thanking Greta, Casper and Something return to the Enchanted Forest, where Casper uses the new magic wand to undo Something's near-tragic error. And once Wendy is restored to normal, the first thing she does is use her new wand to place a "magic circle" around Something to keep him out of further mischief!

"Spooky The Tuff Little Ghost" in "Loyal To Poil", penciled by Howard Post. - Appalled after witnessing Spooky scare a cow into climbing a tree, his ghostly girlfriend Pearl issues an ultimatum -- unless Spooky can go an entire day without scaring anyone, she refuses to date him any more! Intimidated by her dictate, Spooky manages to resist scaring a passing bear who's carrying a big stack of packages. But when Pearl sees Spooky's impressive feat of self-control, she lets out a squeal of delight, revealing herself to the bear - and scaring the daylights out of him! Unaware that Pearl was the cause of this, Spooky worries that she'll blame him. Embarrassed by the effects of her outburst, Pearl makes herself invisible, but when she slips on a banana peel, her cry of alarm scares the horse of a passing dog-cowboy. As the old nag bucks and gallops into the distance, Once again, Spooky is worried that Pearl is going to blame him for this, not realizing that she's the one responsible. Finally, as still-invisible Pearl follows Spooky into town, she accidentally knocks an open can of green paint onto herself. Covered with the verdant goop, she not only scares the painter (an ape) - but also frightens Spooky! After cleaning off herself - by flying through a drum full of turpentine - Pearl catches up with Spooky and gives him a big kiss as a reward for exhibiting such self-control. This causes him to emit such a loud "Ya-hoo!" of total triumph that he scares everyone within earshot!

Instead, read the life story of Dr. Wernher von Braun, the man who entered the USA into the Cold War's Space Race, in this adaptation of a biographic feature film - starring an actor who would someday be much better-known as one of James Bond's most fiendish foes! It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that this week's Oddball Comic aims to please!

So what's so odd about this extremely rare Dell film adaptation? Well, this military story spans World War II and the "Cold War" between America and Russia, yet doesn't feature a single battle scene, swastika or mention of Nazis or Communists! 
Dr. Wernher von Braun (3/23/12 - 6/16/77) was one of the leading figures in the development of rocket technology during and after World War II. Originally creating Germany's deadly V-2 rockets, which devastated London during WWII, he eventually entered the United States though the then-secret "Operation Paperclip". There, he not only became a citizen, but worked on America's ICBM program and served as director of NASA. Dr. von Braun is generally regarded as the father of the United States' space program. 
The film I AIM AT THE STARS was a somewhat fictionalized account of von Braun's youth, wartime experiences and rise to front-page prominence during the "Space Race" between America and Russia in the late 1950s and 1960s..

I AIM AT THE STARS (1960) was a Columbia Picture and a Morningside Production, produced by Charles H. Schneer and directed by J. Lee Thompson from a screenplay by Jay Dratler based on a story by George Froeschel, U. Wolder and H. W. John. It starred Curt Jurgens as Dr. Wernher von Braun and Victoria Shaw as Elizabeth Beyer, with Gia Scala, Herbert Lom and James Daly.

Comic books fans probably best know actor/director/journalist Curt Jurgens for his portrayal of James Bond's foe, shipping magnate Karl Stromberg, in 1977's THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. But interestingly, the career of the Munich, Germany-born Jurgens (12/12/12 - 6/18/82) echoed that of Dr. Wernher von Braun, being one of the first German-born actors to achieve Hollywood stardom the post-WWII western world. First appearing in German films in 1935, Jurgens was deported to a Hungarian concentration camp by the Nazis in 1944, declared "unreliable" by Dr. Joseph Goebbels. After the war, he returned to acting and directing, and in 1955's THE DEVIL'S GENERAL, Jurgens portrayed a German WWII hero who renounces the Nazi creed, thereby attracting international attention to his performance. Other notable films that Jurgens appeared in include THE ENEMY BELOW (1957, in his first American production), AND GOD CREATED WOMAN (1956), LORD JIM (1965), THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU (1968), BATTLE OF BRITAIN (1969) and THE MEPHISTO WALTZ (1971), in addition to many others.

This 32-page adaptation of I AIM AT THE STARS was drawn by cartoonist Jack Sparling. It begins in 1925 Berlin, as young Wernher von Braun and his chubby friend Mischke visit a local planetarium:

PLANETARIUM LECTURER:
And someday mankind will reach out to these unknown planets, stars - these unknown worlds! For whatever man dares to dream, he will accomplish!

MISCHKE:
Wernher, let's go! You'll catch a cold way out there in deep space without a sweater on!

WERNHER VON BRAUN:
All right, Mischke, I - I'm coming! You'll see, Mischke, someday man WILL get to the stars!

MISCHKE:
You and your stars! If you want to get there, you'd better start growing tail-feathers!

As they leave the planetarium, Wernher and Mischke spot a poster for the Berlin Avus Speedway that advertises the "speed trial of Fritz von Opel's rocket-powered automobile", a concept that excites Wernher so much that he can't even sleep that night -- only daydream. (That is, if it's possible to daydream at nighttime) The fact that his mother nags Wernher about his math class grades doesn't particularly help things, either! The following day, at the speedway, Mischke introduces eager Wernher to his friend Anton Reger, who works at the Opel auto factory. When Wernher bombards Anton with questions about the operation of his rocker-powered racecar, von Opel recommends that Wernher read a book by Professor Hermann Oberth called ROCKET TO THE PLANETS. Soon, obsessed with his dreams of space travel, Wernher experiments with model rocketry; in the process, he winds up crashing a rocket into the neighbor's greenhouse, earning his father's ire:

MR. VON BRAUN:
Wernher, thanks to your experiments, I'll have to pay for Becker's greenhouse! What good are those rockets of yours, anyway?

WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Father, what good is a newborn baby? You can't tell until it grows up, can you?

MR. VON BRAUN:
A good question! But anyhow, I insist that if a von Braun shoots off a rocket, it should go where it's supposed to!

WERNHER VON BRAUN: I'll try to remember that, sir!

Soon, Wernher receives his own copy of ROCKET TO THE PLANETS in the mail, he's frustrated to discover that much of its contents are "a lot of mathematics and equations". He decides to ask the aid of his school's new math professor, never realizing that the new instructor is Dr. Hermann Oberth himself:

DR. HERMANN OBERTH:
Young man, I've checked your record! A boy who fails in Latin and math couldn't hope to understand this book!

WERNHER VON BRAUN: Then I'll study harder until I pass!

DR. HERMANN OBERTH:
Tell me why all this means so much to you, my boy!

WERNHER VON BRAUN: Because rockets are important, sir! Someday they'll take mankind to the stars! And someday they'll build a statue to the man who wrote this book!

DR. HERMANN OBERTH:
The man who wrote this book - most people call him a crack-pot! A mad scientist!

WERNHER VON BRAUN: Professor Oberth is a great man! A genius! How can they say such a thing?

DR. HERMANN OBERTH:
Calm yourself, my boy. If I don't mind those names, why should you? All right, Wernher, I'll help you with your math! And just between us - I hated Latin, too!

As the years pass, Wernher becomes Dr. Oberth's assistant. One evening, they prepare a rocket motor demonstration for the Rocket Society. While Dr. Oberth, Mischke, Anton Reger and their gorgeous friend Elizabeth huddle behind a wooden shield, Werner insists on risking his neck by their rocket full of liquid oxygen and igniting its motor by hand. The launch proceeds perfectly! Soon, Dr. Oberth introduces Mischke to Captain Dornberger, a German army official who offers to underwrite their further experimentation by providing "unlimited material, laboratory facilities and test equipment". But as time passes, and Wernher von Braun continues his rocket experiments under Army auspices, the world outside is plunged into the chaos of World War II. But Wernher's activities have not gone unnoticed outside of Germany. In the offices of British Intelligence, a Major Drummond expresses his suspicions regarding Germany's "Peenemunde" area:

MAJOR TOFTOY DRUMMOND:
All our information says that enormous quantities of building materials are being poured into that sector! We've had persistent reports from Dutch, Danish ad Polish sources that the Germans are building a secret weapon there! I'll order special photo reconnaissance missions at once, Major! We'll photograph the Peenemunde area regularly!

Meanwhile, "at that very moment", Wernher narrowly avoids getting blown out of the sky while flying a small plane to observe his rocket post-launch behavior up close and personal. Later that afternoon, Anton is putting romantic pressure on Elizabeth -- who's now Wernher's personal secretary - but she's not particularly receptive to his overtures:

ANTON REGER:
Elizabeth, ever since I got you hat job as Wernher's secretary, you have almost no time for me at all? May I see you tonight?

ELIZABETH BEYER:
You know I'm just as fond of you as ever, Anton! But - well, I just can't see you tonight!

That night, after screening film footage of their latest rocket model, Wernher locks horns with a German army engineer named Neumann:

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN: The vapor trail shows a structural failure in the control vanes!A failure due to the poor quality of steel in the vane!

NEUMANN:
We wouldn't have so much difficulty getting the proper materials if we had closer contact with the S.S. and the heads of the Party!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN: Look, Neumann, I'm a SCIENTIST! I couldn't care less about Hitler and that Party stuff!

NEUMANN:
It's your attitude toward the people in power that keeps us from getting better materials and more money, von Braun!

COLONEL DORNBERGER:
Wernher, this is the third year of the war! The High Command isn't interested in your dreams of space flight! All they want is a rocket that can reach London!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Colonel Dornberger, a rocket that can reach the stars can also be aimed at London - if they insist!

COLONEL DORNBERGER (whispering):
Let's build that rocket before Himmler and the S.S. move in on us! They've already planted Neumann here! He'd love to have your job!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN (whispering):
I know! If he wasn't such a good engineer, I could really dislike him!

That weekend, Wernher returns home to help celebrate his mother's birthday. There, he's greeted by Maria, his lovely sweetheart, but they're interrupted by a man named Weber, who badgers the young scientist about joining the ":Party". (It's interesting to note that, in this post-WWII Dell comic book movie adaptation, the word "Nazi" nor the image of a swastika are ever used even once!), But soon, Wernher and Maria are out in the garden, where she accepts his proposal of marriage. Later, after the party, Wernher's mother inquires:

MRS. VON BRAUN:
Wernher, I heard Weber speaking o you! What are you going to do about joining he Party?

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I don't have much choice, Mother! Not if I want to stay at Peenemunde!

MRS. VON BRAUN:
Long ago they said that witches made a pact with the Devil so they could fly their broomsticks!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
MY broomsticks fly without the Devil's help! But if they didn't I'd be willing to sign up with him!

In the weeks that follow, Himmler and his S.S. - particularly in the form of General Kulp - increase their pressure on Wernher von Braun. With each unsuccessful launch, Wernher's efforts are dismissed as being mere "fireworks" by Kulp. One day, Dr. von Braun and his staff are issued an ultimatum from the High Command: "Unless there will be a successful launching within thirty days, Peenemunde will be closed!" With the pressure on them, the scientist and his staff work harder than ever, night and day. One afternoon, Anton Reger could swear that he sees his beloved Elizabeth using a lipstick-case-camera to photograph the plans for Wernher's new rocket design!

ANTON REGER (thinking):
Strange! What's Elizabeth doing at that drawing board?

But Wernher's work proceeds, and soon, his latest rocket model proves to be a success, exceeding its maximum altitude and delivering a "hit with the force of 50 locomotives at full speed". But summoned to a meeting with Himmler, Wernher refuses to cooperate with his Nazi (oops!) bosses:

REICH-FUHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER:
My congratulations, von Braun! You will want mass-production for your rockets, no doubt! For best results, I suggest you join my PERSONAL STAFF!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I'd like to think about it, Reich-Fuhrer Himmler

REICH-FUHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER:
Hesitating, von Braun? Under the S.S., you'd be free of army stupidity and red tape!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I already AM! Colonel Dornberger is an excellent superior! It was HIGH LEEL indifference that caused our difficulties! 
REICH-FUHRER HEINRICH HIMMLER:
Better think about it, Doctor! The S.S. runs Germany now - and what the S.S. wants, the S.S. gets!

Sure enough, the following day, Wernher von Braun finds himself under government arrest on charges of treason! Soon, he's being interrogated by his old "pal", General Kulp:

GENERAL KULP:
You should have been working on military weaponsyet you were wasting your time planning spaceships like this!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
But scientists MUST plan for the future, General Kulp! Or we'd all still be riding in oxcarts!

For his refusal to cooperate with the Nazi regime, Dr. Wernher von Braun is imprisoned. Fortunately, Colonel Dornberger pulls some behind-the-scenes strings to get his scientist friend released from incarceration:

COLONEL DORNBERGER (talking on the telephone):
I will talk plainly, my Fuhrer! The V-2 may be our last chance for victory! If you want that rocket, you need von Braun to build it!

Returning to Peenemunde, Wernher is soon overseeing production on the V-2 rockets, but confides to his fiancée Maria that he has misgivings he'd prefer to ignore:

MARIA:
This rocket weapon of yours, how can you be sure it wouldn't hit a children's hospital when you fire it?

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Maria, we're fighting a WAR! Women and children are being killed on BOTH SIDES! We CAN'T let ourselves think about it!

Meanwhile, Wernher's V-2 rockets are reducing London into rubble. One rocket lands near the British Intelligence office:

COLONEL TOFTOY:
That was close! That V-2 is quite a firecracker! I'd like to lay hands on the guy who thought of it!

MAJOR TAGGART:
Don't worry, Toftoy! We're planning our own fireworks for those V-2 geniuses!

A week later, Elizabeth receives a mysterious phone message containing a signal for her to leave the V-2 factory before British bombers attack Peenemunde, flattening the rocket base. Wernher and Anton manage to survive, aiding the wounded however they can. Meanwhile, from a café at the edge of town, Elizabeth beholds the awful destruction and - spy or not - she's compelled to re-enter the base to help her co-workers. By the next morning, the death toll has reached over seven hundred people. In the middle of the ruins left by the bombings, Anton Reger confronts Elizabeth about her loyalties; she admits she's been working for "the enemy"; she hates the Nazis (oops!) after the S.S. mistakenly murdered her husband in cold blood. Anton is tempted to turn her in, but since he still loves her, he can't bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, as Germany's defenses begin to crumble, the U. S. Army prepares to sweep into Peenemunde and grab all of their equipment before the Russians get it. They even have plans for the scientists who developed the V-2 rocket, whether or not they're considered to be war criminals. Unaware of these plans, Wernher gathers his staff and makes a startling decision:

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
If we remain here, we'll be grabbed by the Russians! If we head south, the Americans will capture us! Let's face it! Within a week we'll all be prisoners! So I suggest we head south toward the American line!

Wernher's staff agrees with his decision to surrender - all but Anton Reger:

ANTON REGER:
You can't do this, Wernher! It's treason!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Reger, we can't throw away all our years of work advancing rocket technology! We've got to make our knowledge available for others - and complete the job we started!

ANTON REGER:
I'm sorry! I can't follow your smooth reasoning! I'm a German! I stay here!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Then, good-bye, Anton!

Soon, Wernher's convoy of scientists are headed south, arriving at American headquarters to surrender - but they receive a very cold welcome:

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Von Braun, you developed the V-2 that killed thousands of innocent people! Don't you consider yourself a war criminal?

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
In a war, everyone wants his country to win! War itself is a crime - and we are all war criminals!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
If all you Germans had stood up together, you could have stopped Hitler and all his butchery!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
You never lived under a dictatorship, Major! Every man distrusts his neighbor and fears for his own life! In that respect I am guilty of being human!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
You are guilty of putting an infernal weapon into the hands of the most evil government in the world! For that you will be TRIED and HUNG!

Fortunately, Wernher is made an alternate offer:

COLONEL TOFTOY:
Doctor, we recognize your achievements! If you want to go to the United States to continue your research, we have the resources!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I'm happy to agree, sir! That's why I surrendered! But I can't make rockets by myself!

COLONEL TOFTOY:
We have other volunteers, Doctor! You'll all be sent to America on probation! You'll have to face a lot of criticism!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
We didn't expect to be received with open arms!

Wernher learns that this deal was based on the recommendation of one of an undercover U. S. agent, who's waiting in the next room to identify him. After he's gone, Wernher's the topic of a heated conversation:

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Colonel, you don't mean they're not even going to put him ON TRIAL?

COLONEL TOFTOY:
Bill, we've been friends for a long time! Try not to take this as something personal!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Listen! One of his V-2's killed my wife and child in London! It's downright immoral to use him! He's our enemy!

COLONEL TOFTOY:
Yet, when a man is as brilliant as von Braun, I guess he has a special kind of value of his own!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Colonel, as a newspaper man before the war I fought the von Brauns of this world - and I can't stop fighting them now!

Next door, Wernher discovers that the "enemy agent" who's saved him is none other than Elizabeth Beyer! As she checks off a list - which includes Dr. Hermann Oberth - she tearfully realizes that Anton Reger isn't among them. Soon, plans are set in motion to relocate the scientist-prisoners:

COLONEL TOFTOY:
All right, Taggart, here are the orders to ship von Braun and his group to the White Sands proving grounds by plane!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
I was going to suggest passage on a leaky boat, sir!

Accompanied by Taggart and Elizabeth, the captives arrive at White Sands and resume their rocket research. But first, Wernher's former secretary attempts to clear the air between them:

ELIZABETH BEYER:
Gentlemen, we're going to work together, so let us speak of the past and get it over with! It will be easier if we can be friends!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
We're not blaming you, Elizabeth! The stupidity of war is not your fault or ours! You did what you felt you had to do!

Under the resentful observation of Major Taggart, Wernher and his transplanted staff soon make some significant advances with their rocketry development. But no matter what he achieves, Wernher is unable to impress Taggart of his sincerity:

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Staying late again, Doctor? I suppose you're working overtime to earn your citizenship!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Taggart, I can't help how you feel about me, but I was brought here to build rockets, and that's what I'm doing!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
I hope that someday one of your rockets blows up and that you're as close to it as my wife and kid were in London!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I'm sorry about that, Taggart, but I'm not responsible for what happened!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Then who was responsible? Hitler? Himmler? Everyone but you, eh?

ELIZABETH BEYER:
Bill! You've got to stop this!

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
These scientists! They hold the whole world in their hands, but men and women mean nothing to them! They have no loyalty to anything but their own research!

ELIZABETH BEYER:
Bill, you just can't go on living with this hatred!

But as the months pass, the general attitude toward the German scientists finally softens and their status legalized, which eventually leads to citizenship. Maria joins Wernher at White Sands, where he unsuccessfully asks for funding to build "the world's first satellite orbiting the Earth". In June, 1950, the Korean War necessitates that Wernher's group transfers to a new army installation at Redstone Arsenal. Soon, Major Taggart pays a visit to Wernher and his new bride Maria:

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Your traveling orders, von Braun! Not long ago you made rockets to fire at us! Now you'll be building rockets to fire at our enemy! 
DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Do you prefer that I sit back and do nothing, and allow American to lose?

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
How would that affect you, Doctor? You'd be right there working for the Russians!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
If you feel that way, why are you wearing that uniform?

MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
I won't be wearing it after today! I've got a job as a TV news commentator! But you'll be hearing from me! I'll be making it hot for you!

MARIA VON BRAUN:
Taggart is right, Wernher! You'll be making rockets for war again! You could REFUSE! Others have!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Can't you see? I must stay with my work! I can't fall behind! Progress, research, knowledge are MY LIFE!

As Wernher's work proceeds, he and his staff are commended for their design of the Redstone missile. But Taggart now uses his nationally televised forum to criticize Dr. von Braun's goals:

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Taxpayers must demand that their hard-earned dollars be spent for more hospitals, schools and higher salaries for teachers, rather than on a wasteful rocket program!

When the Korean War is over, the government cuts the funding for Wernher's space research. In response, he accepts an invitation to appear on live television in a debate with William Taggart regarding the worth of the exploration of outer space:

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Rocket experiments mean war! We must solve human problems before we think of conquering space!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Our future lies in space! The country with the first satellite will capture the world's imagination!

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Von Braun talks of pure science, but he is the man responsible for the bombing of London!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Man must learn to live with atomic power and rockets, or he will perish!

When the Army missile program gets a new chief, General Medaris, they petition the Pentagon to participate in an attempt to collect and analyze samples of the upper atmosphere with a satellite. Things look good for Wernher and his staff, but they're crushed when the Navy gets the gig instead. Taggart shows up to gloat over his old enemy's defeat, but Elizabeth convinces him to instead offer his sympathies to Dr. von Braun, who reacts badly to Taggart's obvious insincerity. In October, 1957, Wernher - and the entire United States - receives an even more bitter blow as Russia launches the first artificial satellite into orbit around the Earth! But a third stroke of bad luck turns out to be in Wernher von Braun's favor when the Navy's Vanguard missile - the one to be used in the space mission that they lost out on - explodes on the launch pad. Frustrated and embarrassed, the Pentagon turns to Wernher for help, asking him to initiate a crash program to enter the "space race" between America and Russia. At Redstone, Wernher and his crew work on a new satellite-carrying rocket, the JUPITER-C, which is launched into space on January 31st, 1958. The three-stage rocket blasts off and its operation performs flawlessly - with the exception of a six-minute lag -- as it settles its satellite into orbit. Even Bill Taggart is impressed:

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Well, you did it! You know, von Braun, I've almost grown to like you!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
I could say the same about you, Taggart, except that one never really likes one's conscience!

Then Taggart gestures toward his heart:

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
But I'll never really understand what have you scientists got in here - in the place of human values?

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Concern for the future, perhaps! The universe is waiting for us - and we must explore it! That's what makes us men - not vegetables!

EX-MAJOR WILLIAM TAGGART:
Good-bye, von Braun, and good luck with the universe!

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN:
Thank you, Taggart! I'll need it!

This film adaptation ends on an optimistic note, with a panel of Dr. Wernher von Braun observing another rocket launch:

DR. WERNHER VON BRAUN (thinking):
Well, we're catching up at last! The great powers must ultimately be equal in space! It is this balance of power which will secure peace and allow mankind to reach the stars!

So just what is the salty-mouthed seafarer think he's doing by dispensing information and advice on how to earn a lotta spinach in jobs in the communications industry? Has Popeye taken so many hits to the head that he's forgotten that "I yam what I yam"? Find out in POPEYE AND COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA CAREERS, an Oddball educational giveaway comic that's guaranteed to blow you down!

Popeye The Sailor -- the creation of cartoonist Elzie Crisler Segar (1894 - 1938) - was introduced in the King Features syndicated newspaper comic strip, THIMBLE THEATRE on January 17, 1929 (nearly ten years into the strip's run). The strip - created at the urging of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst -- originally concerned itself with the exploits of two adventurers, Castor Oyl and his pal Ham Gravy. Popeye was introduced (as a non-recurring character) when the duo required nautical transportation to a casino located on remote Dice Island, where they planned to strike it rich with their magical Whiffle Hen named Bernice. Segar - whose signature included a cartoon of a cigar butt - discovered that he enjoyed writing and drawing the pugnacious sailor, so much so that he extended his presence in THIMBLE THEATRE. According to COMICS BETWEEN THE PANELS, a verbal history of comics by Steve Duin and Mike Richardson, Segar once expressed that "Popeye is much more than a goofy comic character to me. He represents all my emotions, and he is an outlet for them. I'd like to cut loose and knock the heck out of a lot of people, but my good judgment and size hold me back." Soon after his introduction, the squinty-orbed seaman became THIMBLE THEATRE's star character. Although scrawny overall and without a tooth in his head, the squinty-eyed seafarer had muscular forearms the size of hams, possessed amazing strength and was nearly indestructible. Never one to shirk from a challenge, Popeye's super-abilities were originally attributed to contact with the Whiffle Hen, but was eventually linked to the sailor man's intake of spinach. (In the 1930s, Popeye's dependence on the leafy legume supposedly increased spinach consumption by 33%!) In addition to his emaciated girlfriend, Olive Oyl (Castor's sister and originally, Ham Gravy's girlfriend) THIMBLE THEATER's cast eventually grew to include such classic characters as hamburger-thieving J. Wellington Wimpy, Eugene the Jeep (from the 5th Dimension), Poopdeck Pappy (Popeye's long-lost father), the sinister Sea Hag, the brutal thugs Bluto and Brutus, enigmatic Alice The Goon, demented inventor O.G. Wotasnozzle and many others. When Segar died tragically young (from leukemia), THIMBLE THEATRE - known now in many newspapers simply as "Popeye" - carried on under Charles H. "Doc" Winner and later by Segar's former assistants, Bela Zaboly and Forrest "Bud" Sagendorf. Before Sagendorf took over production of the comic strip entirely in 1958, he wrote and drew dozens of memorable POPEYE comic books, variously published by Dell, Gold Key, King and Charlton, among others. When the POPEYE strip was re-launched in the mid-1980s, it was written and drawn by former underground cartoonist Bobby London; his version of the sailor man combined Segar's classic approach with a distinctive contemporary flavor. Unfortunately, syndicate politics ended Bobby's outstanding run on POPEYE far too prematurely. Since then, chameleon-like "ghost" cartoonist Hy Eisman has been grinding out new Sunday strips for King Features, which currently reprints old POPEYE dailies by Sagendorf.

The Fleischer Studio first animated Popeye in a tryout guest appearance in the 1933 cartoon short BETTY BOOP MEETS POPEYE THE SAILOR. (Other King Features comic strip characters to receive this treatment were Otto Soglo's "Little King" and Carl Anderson's "Henry".) The animated Popeye met with such interest that the Fleischer brothers, Max and Dave, starred him in the first of hundreds of his own theatrical cartoon shorts, I YAM WHAT I YAM, later that year. The Fleischer also produced three memorable (and rather experimental) "Popeye" featurettes, POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS SINDBAD THE SAILOR, POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES and POPEYE THE SAILOR MEETS ALADDIN AND HIS MAGIC LAMP. Studio Renamed Famous Studios when Paramount Pictures bought them in 1942, the cartoon studio continued to produce new theatrical "Popeye" cartoons through 1957. In the early 1960s, a batch of new low budget "Popeye" cartoons was made in "limited animation" for television by a number of studios. A bizarre animated "special" titled POPEYE AND THE MAN WHO HATED LAUGHTER - featuring dozens of other King Features characters -- was produced by Hal (MILTON THE MONSTER) Seegar (no relation) for ABC's SATURDAY SUPERSTAR MOVIE. Hanna-Barbera also made new "Popeye" TV cartoons in the 1970s and 1980s, including the notorious POPEYE AND SON, featuring the adventures of the offspring of a now-married Popeye and Olive. 1980 saw POPEYE as a live-action feature film, written by cartoonist (and former assistant to Will Eisner on THE SPIRIT) Jules Feiffer, directed by Robert Altman, with music by Harry Nilsson and starring Robin Williams as Popeye, Shelly Duval as Olive Oyl, Paul Smith as Bluto, Ray Walston as Poopdeck Pappy and Paul Dooley as J. Wellington Wimpy, In recent years, Popeye has appeared in video games, on slot machines and in a CG made-for-television special.

Exactly why anyone at the King Features Syndicate thought that Popeye was the ideal character to extol the virtues of such inappropriate careers (with the exception of POPEYE AND MARINE SCIENCE CAREERS) is anyone's guess. But when you consider that the "real" Popeye seems unable to replicate the English language with any sort of proper grammar or "pronunskiashun", it's especially ironic (and Oddball) to have the sailor-man hosting his own comic on COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA CAREERS

POPEYE AND COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA CAREERS' untitled, 31-page cover-story was written by Joe Gill and drawn by Ray Dirgo. It begins on its inside-front-cover, as Popeye launches into an exhaustively long-winded introduction - in perfect English, no less - to Swee'pea:

POPEYE:
In this country, we get more information than any other people on Earth, Swee'pea, and I am going to explain to you how we get our information. We can talk to people almost anywhere in the world with this telephone, Swee'pea. Communications help to bring people of the world closer together and increase our understanding of people of other nations. We can find what's happening all over the world from the MEDIAthe word they use for television, radio, newspapers, magazines, movies, tapes and records. Besides the news, Swee'pea, television and radio provide information and entertainment for millions! The entertainment field, of course, is another field with many careers to choose from. More than TWO MILLION PEOPLE work in communications and media, Swee'pea, and many more will be employed in television, radio, newspapers, magazines and the telephone industry in the future. No matter what jobs thee people do, they will all play a part in bringing information to people and helping everyone to communicate with one another. There are many different jobs for men and women, young and old, and anyone can find a job if he is interested and shows he has the ability.

SWEE'PEA:
What will I have to know to get one of these jobs, Popeye?

POPEYE:
That depends on the kind of job that you want and the type that will make you happy, Swee'pea.

Then Popeye takes Swee'pea into the city, showing him examples of the three largest groups of jobs in communications: print, broadcast and telephone/telegraph. (It's interesting to note that this comic was published long before the concept of the Internet!) Then the squinty-eyed swab takes his adopted son into an office building marked "NBS Television", where newscast is in progress. While showing Swee'pea around the place, he addresses the reader with some surprisingly blunt information:

POPEYE:
There are NO SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS for television and radio announcers. TV and radio announcers don't have to be college graduates, but the companies prefer them. They also want men and women who look nice and have clear, pleasing voices.

After a rather jarring scene-shift to a battlefield - demonstrating that radio and TV announcers "have to get out where the news is being made" - Popeye lays some more drier-than-dry information on Swee'pea about the requirements of working as a broadcast technician. Then, Popeye and Swee'pea move on to the offices of the CITY TIMES newspaper, outside of which, Popeye is "mowed down" by an over-enthusiastic journalist. Strolling around the newsroom, Popeye explains the duties of the City Editor and the Sports Editor. Then he delivers an extraordinarily lengthy bit of dialog - by necessity, hand-lettered at a very small size -- all within a single word balloon:

POPEYE:
As you see, newspaper editors are well informed, and can put thoughts into words. Some newspaper only hire men and women to be editors who have a college education and some insist on a degree in journalism, but there are other newspaper jobs for those who have not gone to college. Newspapers also need printing press operators, artists of all kinds, photographers, delivery men and may more. How would you like to be a copy boy, Swee'pea?

(Hmmm, looks to me like this is an example of some last-minute editing. Popeye had better watch out; with any more of these extra-verbose word balloons, he might develop a hunchback!) After visiting the CITY TIMES' nutty-looking Society Editor, staff photographer J. Wellington Wimpy runs by. Popeye assumes he's on the trail of a big story, but typically, Wimpy's on a coffee break and running off to order a dozen hamburgers from a nearby diner. Then Popeye visits a fashion photographer (who's shooting a session with Olive Oyl), the wilderness (where he's chased by a camera-shy bear), an art gallery (where fine artwork is being photographed) and a room marked "Top Secret" (where a suspicious-looking guy is taking photos of classified material with a very tiny camera!) Following a long screed on the requirements for becoming a photographer, Popeye visits a photoengraving company, an art school and a commercial art studio. After posing for a life-drawing class and annoying one of the art school's instructors, a towering stack of magazines topple over on Popeye while he delivers a message about the life of a commercial artist:

POPEYE:
SOMETHING NEW IS HAPPENING EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY. PEOPLE WORKING IN COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA HELP TO TELL IT LIKE IT IS! THEY LOVE THEIR WORK LIKE I LOVE SPINACH!

Geez, calm down, ya swab! Next, Popeye pays a visit to a factory to see how a newspaper is printed. (One of these panels has been very poorly printed - with smudged and bleeding black ink that makes it difficult to read its hand-lettered copy -- which is rather ironic, considering that this comic was actually printed on Charlton's privately-owned printing presses!) As Swee'pea re-joins him, Popeye tells him about potential careers in the telephone business. Visiting the offices of a phone company, we see Olive Oyl working as a phone operator, one of over 400,000 of them in the country:

POPEYE:
Nearly all telephone operators are girls, Swee'pea, but there are a few men too.

Then the old salt takes Swee'pea to a privately-run office building and introduces the human tadpole to women who works as a receptionist and phone switchboard operator, one of whom has skin the color of a ripe lemon. (I guess she's supposed to be Asian; either that, or it's just another example of Charlton's hit-or-miss printing.) This sequence ends with Popeye sleeping on a park bench located outside the phone company's headquarters!

POPEYE:
One of the drawbacks to being a telephone operator is you may have to work nights sometimes and you may have to work on week-ends or holidays.

Later, we catch up with Popeye at the local airport, where he takes us inside the control tower to watch various air traffic ground controllers doing their job. One of 'em, apparently another lemon-skinned Asian, receives a comedic electrical shock while tightening a loose wire in his instrument console. Then, after a mind-numbing page on the legal requirements needed to work in airline radio-operator jobs, Popeye finally gets to do what he does best. (No, he doesn't beat the snot out of a bully.) He rows a dinghy out to an offshore ship to visit its Morse code operator. Then he visits a train yard, where he watches a train dispatcher use the telegraph to do his job. Apparently, Popeye's so immersed in his mission to teach Swee'pea about jobs in the communication and media that he forgets that he's standing on the train tracks - it takes a warning cry from Swee'pea to alert him to an oncoming train - and he leaps to safety at the last second! Finally, Popeye takes a look at the job of phone company linemen, "some of the most important communications workers". In the middle of a blinding snowstorm - one so thick that cartoonist Ray Dirgo is able to get away with leaving one panel blank - we're shown a phone company's cable splicer working in a canvas shelter high above the ground. In a rare bit of humor, Popeye wryly comments:

POPEYE:
They told him he'd get plenty of fresh air on this job!

Later, back at home, while Popeye reads the newspaper, Swee'pea reads a POPEYE comic book, considering his options regarding a future career in communications and media. But when he's interrupted to answer the ringing telephone, he's amused to realize it's a wrong number - the caller's speaking Chinese!

It's interesting to note that, despite its rather inventive, four-way cover design, the artwork in this issue of PICTURE PROGRESS is about as blandly institutional as humanly possible, without a single word balloon or specific character. This may be due to its educational nature, but more likely, was intended to distance itself from newsstand "funnybooks" that, in 1954, were then-currently the target of psychologist Dr. Frederic (SEDUCTION OF THE INNOCENT) Wertham's demonizing of comic books in general.

The title of this 24-page (plus covers) giveaway comic's cover-story is "The Four Seasons". It opens with this intro:

INTRODUCTORY NARRATIVE CAPTION:
All living things - human beings, animals, plants and insects - change with the changing seasons. Have you ever wondered why we have seasons?

Then, with a series of diagrams of the relative positions of Earth and sun, the cause of the four seasons is explained:

NARRATIVE CAPTION:
The seasons are caused by the way the sun shines upon the earth. The earth spins around on a make-believe line we call the axis. See how the earth leans over to one side. It takes one full day (24 hours) for the earth to spin all the way around on its axis. The sun can only shine on half the earth at one time. That is shy we have day while the other half of the earth is having night. As the earth is spinning on its axis, it is also moving all the way around the sun. It takes a whole year (365 days) to make this trip. As the earth moves around the sun, the sun shines upon it in different ways during the year. This is what causes us to have seasons. Summer is hot because we have the heat and light of the sun directly over us. It gets cooler in the autumn because our part of the earth is moving away from the direct sunlight. Winter is the coldest part of the year. That is when our part of the earth is furthest from the direct heat of the sun. In the spring, the weather gets warmer because we have moved back toward the direct sunshine. Now let us see what happens on our part of the earth during the four seasons.

The second chapter of this issue of PICTURE PROGRESS is titled "Spring Begins March 20". We're shown how the snow and ice melts and the ground defrosts and softens, "making it ready for nature to awaken". As sap flows within trees and plants, blossoms begin to appear, attracting bees from their honeycomb. The bees bring back nectar to their queen, who then lays approximately 4,000 eggs, one of which will someday become the new queen. We see how beavers build dams on water-swollen rivers, and a mother chipmunk digs a series of interconnected warrens and tunnels. A pair of robins, having migrated back from a winter spent in the South, builds their next in a tree. After the mama bird lays her eggs, she and the father bird takes turns sitting on the eggs and foraging for food until their babies hatch. With the weather turning warmer, farmers plant seeds that will become their crops. Elsewhere, on a pond's surface, a bullfrog suns himself and hunts for tiny fish, while a mother frog lays her eggs at the pond's muddy bottom. Soon, her eggs will hatch into tadpoles. In the world of humans, life's activities accelerate as well:

NARRATIVE CAPTION:
We have seen the beginning of spring in the country. But spring also comes to the city. The stores have new spring clothes. The baseball season starts in Washington, D.C. The President of the United States usually throws out the first ball. As the days get warmer and longer, children play outside until evening. Son the school children will begin their summer vacation.

The third chapter, "Summer Begins June 21", starts with a montage of summertime activities -- including what looks like scowling gonzo journalist Dr. Hunter S. Thompson spending a day at the beach! Meanwhile, the clutch of eggs of those robins that we met earlier have finally hatched, and their baby chicks have grown to an age when "summer school" is necessary to teach them to fly and dig for worms. Elsewhere, a hungry bear raids the bees' honeycomb. By night, beavers train their young to gnaw down trees, while chipmunk babies evade a weasel by hiding in their underground next. In the nearby pond, the tadpoles have matured into full-grown frogs. The queen bee and her subjects abandon their honeycomb, leaving it to their industrious offspring. The next chapter, "Autumn Begins August 23", opens with this update on farm life:

NARRATIVE CAPTION:
Our part of the earth is now leaning away from the sun. Both man and animal store food and patch up their homes for the coming winter. The farmer harvests his crops. The housewife cans food for the winter. Storm windows go up. Children go back to school.

Meanwhile, the beavers and the chipmunks prepare for winter, gathering stores of wood and nuts in their respective hiding-holes. Many birds prepare to migrate south, leaving their summer homes, although sparrows, crows and hawks remain in their nests for the rest of autumn and winter. 
NARRATIVE CAPTION:
The cooler weather comes. The leaves on the trees turn red, brown and gold. They begin to fall off. Then, one windy night, the trees stand bare.

Field mice move into abandoned nests, while the bees gather together inside their honeycomb to avoid freezing to death. The chipmunks and the beavers hunker down in their nests until spring. The frogs hibernate in the mud at the bottom of their pond to keep warm beneath the frozen ice. Rabbits fur changes color to white, protective coloration to allow them to hide from their predators. The rising winds are filled with millions of seeds, destined to sprout in the spring. As "Winter Begins December 22", this comic's fifth and final chapter, opens, nearly all of the animals we've seen earlier are in hiding or in hibernation, emerging from their homes only when it's necessary to gather food. A white rabbit is nearly killed by a hungry fox, but it manages to scamper back into its underground warren. Meanwhile, civilization adjusts to the harsher conditions:

NARRATIVE CAPTION:
Winter comes to the city, covering the gray buildings and the bare trees with a frosty, fairyland cloak. The park lakes freeze and become a winter playground. Night comes early. The street lights throw shadows on the empty sidewalks, while the people stay in their warm homes and wait for spring to come.

Also included in this issue of PICTURE PROGRESS are these features:


An untitled, black-and-white inside-front-cover activity page, challenging the reader to unscramble the letters of the names of six flowers and six birds.

That is why it is always summertime at the equator", "It would take an airplane flying at 150 miles an hour nearly 71 years to go from the earth to the sun", "Winter is an old German word meaning 'time of water.' This is because of all of the snow and rain that fall during this time of year", and "Many, many years ago, men would look up at the stars and know when the seasons were going to change".


ODDBALL Factoid - Although Robert Overstreet's COMIC BOOK PRICE GUIDE lists PICTURE PROGRESS as a continuation of Gilberton's PICTURE PARADE, according to the author of PICTURE PARADE No. 1's "Andy's Atomic Adventure", it was actually a competing title!";s:6:"author";s:11:"Scott Shaw!";s:7:"pubDate";s:29:"Fri, 24 Feb 2006 08:00:00 PST";}}s:11:"items_count";i:164;}
